This paper extends the application of spatial econometrics models to analyze interactions and heterogeneity among governorates in the Tunisian labor market based on the matching function. Due to the limited information provided by the contiguity matrix, we suggest a spatial weight matrix based on multidimensional scaling to tackle heterogeneity and spatial agglomeration; The socio-economic weight matrix summarizes interactions among the 24 governorates given the characteristics of each one (socio demographic environment, employment and economic environment, and quality of life) and the flow weight matrix that takes into account the flows of migrations among regions, using the technique proposed in Hondroyiannis (2009). To test the proposed matrices, we have used spatial econometrics techniques on panel data (Spatial Durbin model, spatial error model, and spatial autoregressive model) to take into account spatial effects (proximity interaction and spatial heterogeneity). Our results show that jobseekers in neighboring governorates cause a difficulty in the matching process in the local market.
